# KIAM
## The K Identifyer for the LKSO and +LKNC$ interactions
The KIAM is the 

If you want to authenticate your users using a KUSER but with the same KIAM protocols, we have a section for that; but first, please understand properly how the KIAM works, because at the end each KUSER is a "child" of a KIAM; and altough each KUSER can have their own KIAM and have KUSERS in their own, the Lucky Network Privacy Initiative does not allow to exchange identyfiable or tracable data between any of theirs or your KUSERS and you as a KIAM or another KIAM. Only anonymized, crunched data will be available and all personal identyfiable data will die within the open space even when encrypted. A KSOID identyfier will be internally used and for increased security concerns it will be randomized along with other security and cryptographic techniques. Your KIAM Personal Information is needed to create a trusted account and will be securely stored. If for any reason the Lucky Network Source Code Trust Commitee Validation Association or the Lucky Network Source Code Trust Commitee flags your KIAMP as "risky" and you do not personally respond to the communications requests with proper authentication of communication protocols your Lucky Network Trusted Developer Account will be deauthorized and your Personal Information will be archived securely for 129,600 minutes in case any Government Authenticated and Verified Legal Institution requests to identify you because of a Demonstrated International Illegal Attempt To Damage previously passed the Proof of Personal Identification Demonstrated and so it will be Publicly Available in the Lucky Network Security Portal for the time the DIIAD Smart Contract is alive. The publication will only be displayed in the Official Lucky Network Security Portal and will not be publicly shared or optimized for Internet Search Engines. We will use different techniques to try to reduce the robotic tracers for sensitive information yet we can not warranty that third party systems gain and copy that information even when the DIIAD Smart Contract time of existance is very short.
